2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Making Changes

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the coding standards below

3. **Test your changes** thoroughly:
   ```bash
   # Backend testing
   cd backend
   python test_api.py
   
   # Frontend testing
   cd frontend
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Commit your changes** with clear messages:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: feature description"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork** and create a pull request:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Python (Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide

## Development Tips

### Debugging
- Use Flask debug mode for backend development
- Check browser console for frontend errors
- Monitor API responses in Network tab
- Use print statements or logging for troubleshooting

### Performance
- Profile slow queries in the RAG pipeline
- Optimize embedding generation for large documents
- Consider caching for frequently accessed data
- Monitor memory usage during development

### Security
- Never commit API keys or sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Use HTTPS in production
- Follow security best practices for Flask and Next.js
